# GS2-Obfuscator 
A Simple GS2 Obfuscator GS2-Obfuscator is a HTML/JavaScript tool designed to facilitate obfuscation and deobfuscation of GraalScript 2 code by encoding strings, properties, numbers and function calls using the Base64 encoding scheme. It helps hide variable names, values and other logic, making the code harder to understand at first glance. The tool supports recursive decoding and encoding and will have the option to use different encoding schemes in the future. **This tool is not PERFECT**, but it will work for **MOST** GS2 scripts.

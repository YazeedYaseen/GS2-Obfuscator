# GS2-Obfuscator 
GS2-Obfuscator is a HTML/JavaScript tool designed to facilitate obfuscation and deobfuscation of GraalScript 2 code by encoding strings, properties, numbers and function calls using the Base64 encoding scheme. It helps hide variable names, values and other logic, making the code harder to understand at the surface level. The tool supports multi-layer decoding and encoding. **This tool is NOT PERFECT**, but it will work for **MOST** GS2 scripts. Deobfuscation right now is experimental and might not work as expected.
